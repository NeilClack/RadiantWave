# Radiant Wave User Manual  

## Keybinds  
These are the basic keybinds for navigating Radiant Wave and operating the program.  
Should you find a keybind that does something and is not listed here, please email nclack@radiantwavetech.com  

> When you see key combinations such as "SHIFT + UP ARROW", press and hold the first key, in this case SHIFT
> then press the second key. Do not hold the second key as right now, there is no way to stop a flood of commands
> from being sent to the program, and you could send more than the program can handle, causing things to "continue happening after you've let go of the keys".
